# Task 2 – Java Array Operations with Git Version Control

## 📌 Objective
Write a Java program using basic data structures and demonstrate understanding of Git and GitHub version control practices.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

1. Accept 5 or more integers from the user and store them in an array.
2. Sort the array using a custom sorting algorithm (Selection Sort used here).
3. Find the **second highest** and **second lowest** numbers in the array **without** using built-in functions.
4. Use Git and GitHub to manage code versions using **branches**, **commits**, and **pull requests**.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Manual implementation of **Selection Sort**
- Handles input validation (requires at least 3 elements)
- Displays:
  - Original Array
  - Sorted Array
  - Second Highest Value
  - Second Lowest Value
